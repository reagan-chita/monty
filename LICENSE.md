The MIT License gives people the permission to use and get software for free, allowing them to do things like copying, modifying, and selling it, but they have to include a notice that shows who owns the copyright and the permission, and the software doesn't come with any guarantees, so the authors or owners can't be held responsible for any problems that might happen when using it.
